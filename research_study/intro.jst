        Welcome! I appreciate your participation in this study.  
        This assessment is designed to explore potential implicit biases among STEM educators teaching grades 6â€“12. The process includes the following steps:
    </p>
    <ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
        <li>A brief survey assessing your self-perceived levels of racial bias.</li>
        <li>A replicated version of Harvard's Implicit Association Test (IAT).</li>
        <li>Immediate display of your results from both the survey and the IAT.</li>
        <li>Six follow-up questions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
        The entire assessment will take no more than approximately 15 minutes to complete.
