            Welcome! I appreciate your participation in this study.  
            This assessment is designed to explore potential implicit biases among STEM educators teaching grades 6â€“12. The process includes the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>A brief survey assessing your self-perceived levels of racial bias.</li>
                <li>A replicated version of Harvard's Implicit Association Test (IAT).</li>
                <li>Immediate display of your results from both the survey and the IAT.</li>
                <li>Six follow-up questions.</li>
            </ol>
            The entire assessment will take no more than approximately 15 minutes to complete. You may stop at any time.  
            <br>
            Please note that all responses and results are <strong>completely anonymous</strong>, even to me as the researcher. Your honesty is vital for this research, and your participation is greatly appreciated. Thank you!
